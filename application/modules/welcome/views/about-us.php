			<p><strong>Why we Strated</strong><br/>


When we started our journey we travelled and studied all about tours. We realised there are two types of Tours, Budgeted and Luxurious.
The Luxuriours tours may turn out to be expensive, and Budgeted tours have some drawbacks as well. So we worked on it and introduced 'Luxurious Affordable Tours'.
<br/>
Earlier we were known by 'Dream Ways Tourism', then we introduced a new name 'Vinaya Tours'. We are glad that we have provided our service to 700+ clients and we will continue doing it to make our tourist's journey memorable and joyous.
